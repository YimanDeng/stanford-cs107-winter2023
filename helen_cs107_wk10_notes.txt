Process
  A process is an instance of a program in execution
  Each program in the system runs in the context of some process
  Key abstractions of processes:
    independent logical cotroll flow
    private address space
  What is a processor/CPU?
    the engine that interprets or executes instructions stored in main memory
    ALU (arithmetic logic unit), CU (control unit), memory unit, cache memory, registers
    
Memory
  What is virtual memory?
    an abstraction of main memory. 
    - Uses main memory as a cache for the disk
    - provides each process with a uniform address space
    - protects the address space of each process from corruption by other processes
